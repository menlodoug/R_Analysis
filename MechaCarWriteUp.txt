MPG Regression
There are several variables that need to be included in the multiple regression model for Mecha_Car.  
These are: vehicle.length, vehicle.weight, spoiler.angle, ground.clearance, AWD.  of these, vehicle.length
and ground.clearance have the largest influence on the model.  The p-values are 2.60e-12 and 5.21e-08,
respectively.  Vehicle weight, with a p-value of 0.0776 is not too far from the .05 threshhold, but not low
enough to be considered significant (or non-random).

The combined effect of the variables, produces a p-value of 5.35e-11, using the multiple linear regression, 
substantially below 0.05.  If the results were non-random, the slope of the linear model would be zero, so 
in this case, the slope is definitely not zero.  Here are the results.

"In most sciences, results yielding a p-value of .05 are considered on the borderline of statistical significance. 
If the p-value is under .01, results are considered statistically significant and if it's below .005 they are 
considered highly statistically significant." (Institute for Work & Health, April 2005).  With a p-value as low 
as 5.35e-11, the combination of variables included in this model can be very predictive in Mecha_Car mpg.

Suspension Coil Summary
Here is the summary table from the production of 3 suspension coil lots.

Manufacturing_Lot   Mean    Median  Variance    St_Dev  Min_PSI Max_PSI
Lot1	            1500.00	1500.0	0.9795918	0.9897433	1498	1502
Lot2	            1500.20	1500.0	7.4693878	2.7330181	1494	1506
Lot3	            1496.14	1498.5	170.2861224	13.0493725	1452	1542

Quality control was, apparently, very stringent in Manufacturing Lot 1, and slightly less so in Manufacturing Lot 2.
The production team for Lot 3 must have come to work after visiting the local saloon as their PSI numbers were all
over the map.  The calculated variance for lot 3 was 170.28, so the production crew failed miserably to meet that
design specification.

Suspension Coil T-Test
Using a one-sample T-Test, it cannot be established that suspension coil’s pound-per-inch results are statistically
different from the mean population results of 1500 psi.  However, if you perform the paired t-test, comparing
results between lots (1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, and 2 vs 3), the results are significantly different when looking at results
involving Lot 3.  For Lot 1 vs 2 the p-value = 0.4432, for Lot 2 vs 3, the p-value = 0.01002, and for Lot 1 vs 3,
the p-value = 0.03012.  Finally, here are results from an ANOVA test:

Here again, the issues with Manufacturing Lot 3 come into focus.

Design Your Own Study
To compare Mecha_Car prototypes versus the competition, A/B Testing should be employed.  A/B testing uses a control
and experimental group to test potential changes using a success metric. A/B testing is used to test whether or not 
the distribution of the success metric increases in the experiment group instead of the control group.

For categorical variables like color, a chi-squared test should be used.  Despite having no quantitative input, the 
chi-squared test enables data scientists to quantify the distribution of categorical variables. It’s important, 
though, to keep the number of unique values and groups relatively low (under 20).  If testing for consumer opinion
on color, for example, the null hypothesis would be that there is no association between vehicle color and consumer
preference.

If looking at numeric variables like price, a z-score test will work best if the sample size is small and a 
two-sample t-test if the sample size is large.  For the z-score test, let's say you want to look at price.  The
null hypothesis would be that a change in price would not produce a significant difference in consumer preference.
A p-value of less than 0.5 would prove the alternative hypothesis, that the price difference did impact consumer
preference.  This would be a one-tailed z-test.  Similarly, the default null hypothesis for a 2-sample t-test is
that the two groups are equal.
